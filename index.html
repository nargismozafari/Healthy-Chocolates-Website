                        Healthy chocolate? It may sound like a scam at first, but there's plenty of truth to it. Made
                        from the best selection of cacao beans, each piece retains the nutritional value of the tree’s
                        fruit. From reducing blood pressure and stress, to improving brain function whilst boosting
                        immunity and heart health, chocolate can be good for you. Needless to say, the benefits only
                        exist if it's consumed in moderation. Learn more from our website and explore a healthy
                        relationship with chocolate!

                    <h3>What is your chosen infographic topic and why is this a topic you wish to research?</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Our chosen topic is chocolate. We chose this topic because chocolate is
                        often seen as unhealthy, but in reality, there are many benefits to eating chocolate in
                        moderation. Chocolate is rich in flavanols like epicatechin, catechin, anthocyanins, and
                        phenolic acids. All of these substances assist in reducing cellular inflammatory response,
                        enhancing cognitive function, and enhancing immune, cardiovascular, and brain health.</p>
                    <h3>Intended audience - Describe the type of students this infographic is targeted towards and why,
                        eg age group, ethnicity, gender, interests, etc</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        The intended audience of this infographic is children who are taught growing up that chocolate
                        is unhealthy: especially children under the age of 10. Children in this age range are informed
                        about the negative impacts of eating chocolate in excess and are therefore unaware of its
                        benefits. This infographic will encourage children to consume chocolate in moderate doses,
                        especially dark chocolate as it can be beneficial for their development.
                        Children will also receive validation for their desire to consume more chocolate because they
                        are more likely to be persuaded to consume more chocolate if we entertain confirmation bias,
                        causing them to remember details that support their desire to eat more chocolate.
                        Since the infographic targets children younger than 10, design considerations will appropriately
                        appeal to them as we will incorporate vibrant colours, eye-catching cartoonish and rounded
                        graphics, playful fonts, and simple language.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What will you do to ensure the integrity of your primary and secondary data (i.e reliable and
                        free from bias)?</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        In committing to uphold integrity, we will follow the “CRAAPS” criteria to rate the credibility
                        of both primary and secondary sources, only utilising data that aligns appropriately with the
                        criteria, which are as follows:
                        <br />Currency - is the data out of date?
                        <br />Relevance - is the data relevant to your purpose?
                        <br />Authenticity - is the data sourced from a reputable figure?
                        <br />Accuracy - is the data valid and not misconstrued or misleading?
                        <br />Purpose - what was the reason for the data being published?
                        <br />By following these criteria, we can hold the credibility of the data used to a high
                        standard.

                        achieve?</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">The primary goal of this infographic is to inform people about the
                        benefits of chocolate and to showcase fun facts about chocolate. Chocolate is often a food that
                        is misunderstood, so we aim to correct the myths and shed light on the little-known positives of
                        chocolate. By representing it from a healthier perspective, we can persuade our target audience
                        to enforce the guilt-free consumption of chocolate.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        How often do you eat chocolate? Why? <br /> What are the negative impacts you've heard about
                        chocolate consumption? <br /> Are you aware of the benefits of chocolate? <br /> Did you know
                        that the antioxidants in chocolate can support heart/skin health, immunity, motivation, and good
                        blood flow? <br />Did you know that chocolate can boost energy and focus levels?<br /> Do you
                        know what makes dark chocolate different from milk and white chocolate?<br /> Do you believe
                        that chocolate causes acne?<br /> Do you believe that chocolate causes headaches?<br /> Do you
                        believe chocolate lacks any nutritional value?
                    </p>
                    <h3>What will you do to ensure the ethical collection, storage and use of collected data? </h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        To ensure the ethical collection of data we will first make sure to get their informed consent
                        before collecting any data, giving them the option to reject the data collection entirely. We
                        will ensure that they are aware of why we are collecting data, who will have access to it, how
                        the data will be used and where it will be presented. Data that is collected will be
                        de-identified to the person as it is stored in a spreadsheet, to respect their privacy by
                        providing anonymity.
                        When storing the data, we will ensure each member has secure access rights and that the data is
                        not shared with anyone else throughout the process. Once the data has been exported into a
                        spreadsheet, we will upload the file to a Google Spaces file-sharing system so only team members
                        can access the spreadsheet, utilising Google's encryption services and only providing access
                        rights to those in the team. Backups of the collected data will be stored on a physical USB
                        drive, which will be maintained with care.
                        When handling the data we will act according to obligations made in a consent agreement,
                        prioritising the security of data and maintenance of confidentiality. Moreover, we will ensure
                        that participants are informed of the details of our data collection including the purpose of
                        its collection, who has access to their data, how it will be used, and where it will be
                        presented.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="conclusion_content">
                <p>According to the data collected in our survey, there are biased opinions against the consumption of
                    chocolate. However this was proven to be exaggerated as research revealed many benefits when
                    consumed in
                    moderation. Being packed with antioxidants, it is able to support heart, skin and brain health and
                    is
                    also a convenient way to intake more iron and magnesium. This is slightly surprising to us as we
                    also
                    grew up in a society which categorises chocolate as ‘unhealthy’. However, some of us already knew
                    about
                    the positive side of eating chocolate thanks to easily accessible information on the internet. There
                    wasn’t anything too surprising but one of our favourite fun facts that we didn’t know about before
                    was
                    that cacao beans were once used as currency in an ancient civilisation. We also now know that
                    chocolate
                    is poisonous to cats and dogs so we can be sure to keep pets safe and away from chocolate!</p>
